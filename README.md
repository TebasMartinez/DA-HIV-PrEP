# Data Analysis: HIV and PrEP

# Questions
- Is an increase in PrEP users connected to a decrease in new HIV cases?
- Is an increase in ART coverage connected to a decrease in new HIV cases?
- Does PrEP use correlate with an increase or decrease of other STIs?

# Data Sources & Data Retrieval Methodology
